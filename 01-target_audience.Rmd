# Target Audience

This module is made to provide opportunities for students, especially **underserved and minority students**, at higher education facilities to explore and critically think about environmental justice data using EJScreen and other tools. We intend this module to be interdiscplinary / discipline agnostic, so that students of multiple disciplines and majors can participate. 

It targets the **lower division level (undergraduate) students**, across a variety of disciplines (e.g., biology, social science) at Tier 1.

Tiers 2 and 3 will target more advanced students, potentially graduate students or students completing a research capstone.

"Marketing" could focus on HBCUs, historically-womenâ€™s colleges, community colleges, etc. But, it is open to anyone and should be adaptable for that purpose.
