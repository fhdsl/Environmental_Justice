# About These Modules {-}

This is a collection of modules intended to teach students about environmental justice through the [EPA's EJ Screen tool](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen).

These modules use a three-tiered system to educate across experience levels. Modules are also broken up by the intended audience: data science and/or STEM majors, social science majors, and those participating in socially engaged arts learning.
