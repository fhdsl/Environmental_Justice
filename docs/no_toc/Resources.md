# NEXT STEPS {-}

## Short term:

- Organize target faculty to get their input on module
- Input from experts/practitioners familiar with EJScreen
- Dissemination of the modules and resources 
    - ESA discovery (Alison)
    - CourseSource

## Long term:

- Apply for a grant to work with teachers to develop modules and pilot the modules in their courses 
- Select a team interested in working on submitting funding applications
- Identify and select grant opportunities for developing educational resources or funding a working group on environmental data science education
- Submit grant applications! 
- Potential Funding Sources: 
    - Research Experience for Teachers (NSF) https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18089/nsf18089.jsp
    - Existing Data Science centers?: e.g. ESIIL: https://esiil.org/
    - Curriculum Development Grants (e.g. Cal State https://www.calstate.edu/impact-of-the-csu/research/csuperb/Documents/2023CurriculumDevelopmentRFP-final.pdf)
    - Educational grants: https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/brdo/funding-education-research-programs-and-training
    - Institute of Education Sciences grants: https://ies.ed.gov/funding/ncer_progs.asp
    - Sloan Center For Systemic Change (Graduate Level): https://sloan.org/programs/higher-education/diversity-equity-inclusion/scsc-call
    - HHMI - no open relevant calls but has had relevant grants in the past
    - NEA Foundation: https://www.neafoundation.org/educator-grants-and-fellowships/
    - https://www.spencer.org/grant_types/racial-equity-special-research-grants
    - https://www.spencer.org/grant_types/small-research-grant
    - https://mccartheydressman.org/teacher-development-grants/
    - NSF division of undergraduate education: https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities?sort_bef_combine=nsf_funding_upcoming_due_dates_DESC&f%5B0%5D=division%3A215

- Translate/develop modules into different languages ? (maybe geared towards a different audience though)
- Make a data nugget? (no environmental justice focused ones already??) https://datanuggets.org/search-current-data-nuggets/
- FIX THE PACKAGE AND/OR Contact the maintainer


# Resources {-}

[ejscreen R package](http://ejanalysis.github.io/ejscreen/)

Google slides for instructor to give background: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hGCkesvIgccjunUQzVRuHEp1aZNIDyMW9BdAonpN40M/edit#slide=id.p 

Background readings (and/or intro lecture?) to frame: 
What is EJ and why is it relevant? 
What is EJScreen?
Why was this tool created and how is it used (and by who)? 
What data was used/is used for the tool? 
What are the general outputs of the tool? - general overview, diving into issues and understanding later

Google slides for lecture for class to give students background 
Guided worksheet for readings to help students break them down (and key with example answers)
Do we want to revise the existing EJscreen pdf document that describes how to use it? 
Clearly commented code that underlies the module with potential variations

This is a very helpful breakdown on EJ Screen

One activity could be to analyze EJ screen through algorithmic ecology: https://stoplapdspying.medium.com/the-algorithmic-ecology-an-abolitionist-tool-for-organizing-against-algorithms-14fcbd0e64d0
