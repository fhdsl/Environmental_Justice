# Learning Outcomes by Subject

When students complete this module, they will be able to:

## Science/Data Science

### Overarching LOs - to be applied at all tiers

- Understand how data science can be used to create environmental solutions for communities
- Place data science questions in context (ecological, environmental, community solution, etc)
- Understand complexities and limitations of data
- Evaluate drawbacks/benefits of tools like EJScreen
- Interpret results in context (ecological, environmental, community solution, etc)

### Tier 1 (Intro level)

*Prerequisite Knowledge: None!*

- Explain how environmental indices can affect their community
- Evaluate the differences in the tools (EJScreen vs CEJST vs state-based(?) tools)
- And the benefits/drawbacks of the tools and how underlying data influences results (e.g., EJScreen uses census data - that is biased)
- Evaluate the positives and negatives of abstracting a place to one number
- Understand how weighting can impact results
- Question policy-makers and land managers on environmental justice issues
- Collaboratively develop action plans to move forward from their findings (wording of this sentence?) 
- Tier 2 (Mid level)

*Prerequisite Knowledge: Basic introduction to data science and statistical analyses, e.g. *

- Access data through R
- Execute pre-written example code and interpret the results
- Construct and modify R code to test hypotheses
- Choose a place and tell a story about why it is identified as an EJ place. What is missing? Is there a place that you thought would show up in EJ screen but does not? What data gap makes that happen?

### Tier 3 (Upper Division)

*Prerequisite Knowledge:*

- Student-driven project initiatives (SMART principles)
- Formulate a testable question
- Justify why this question is interesting with appropriate background information
- Create a justified hypothesis
- Obtain data from public sources (like EJ screen)
- Process raw data into usable formats
- Analyze data with appropriate statistical methods to answer the question
- Visualize data 
- Contextualize results in broader context ((ecological, environmental, community solution, etc)
- Communicate results through - e.g. a paper, poster, flash talk, other format

- quantitative models to address scientific questions?
- Testable question
- Placed in the context
- Obtaining, cleaning, transforming, and processing raw data into usable formats?
- Apply a range of statistical methods for inference and predictionâ€¦
- Build data science products that can be used by a broad audience - or can be transferable to other broader contexts

## Social Science:

Geared towards students who
Never have made a map before

### Tier 1: 

Explain how environmental data science tools reflect our understandings of race and can both perpetuate and challenge racism 
Interpret maps
Expand understanding of maps (through resources like this counter mapping project and memory maps)
Navigate the EJScreen tool and/or other similar tools to answer relevant, student-generated research questions about environmental (in)justice
Understand how these can benefit their own community and neighborhood 

### Tier 2:

Involve in ethnographic studies 
Be able to infer data with a broad socio-economic context
Visualization of data using programming languages such as R
Dig into the 
Maybe tie-up with different environmental law firms to get a hands-on learning experience by interning/volunteering!
Be able to come up with concept maps to project a boarder relationship with different interactions
Think of gathering qualitative data through interviews and surveys that are based around ethics 

### Tier 3: 

Placement opportunities for students interested in continuing this field of science 
Introduce public health implications of the data and research?
Discuss data ethics? 

## Socially Engaged Art:

Geared towards students who

- Are interested in creatively expressing and communicating their data analysis
- Are interested in connecting and engaging in reciprocal story sharing with local community members about pertinent environmental justice issues

### Tier 1: communication (2-3 weeks)

*Tier objective* : introduce students to science communication, socially engaged art, and research translation with hands-on activities between students and with the general public

- Students read foundational literature on the history of socially engaged art practices, and how science, art, and agency are tied together.
- Students create a representation of the results from the Data Science and Social Science subjects that can be shared with classmates and the broader community
- Representations could take the form of ArcGIS StoryMaps, collage, art installation, composition, art/dance/theater performance, a poster, presentation, etc.
- Do a site visit with students and teachers to see the EJ community first-hand and learn from locals (example: Dakota Bdote tour)
Class creates a gallery show and/or hosts an event to share creative works with each other and community members.

### Tier 2: storytelling (2 weeks)

*Tier objective* : Students and community members come to a more holistic understanding of the different experiences and perspectives related to environmental justice, for example of how personal experiences are part of  shared experiences or a larger picture

- Organize a gathering of students and residents with different breadths of traditional and ancestral knowledge like teachers and Indigenous leaders.
- Storytelling preparation:
    - Hold a reflection session (individually or in groups) and a writing workshop to be able to put ideas and thoughts into words more effectively
    - Run a storytelling workshop for students to practice telling and listening to stories
- Facilitate an organic sharing and listening of stories between students and community members related to environmental justice from embodied experiences, research, data analysis

### Tier 3: co-creation of knowledge (longterm, multi-year)

*Tier objective*: Build and sustain healthy relationships between students, local stakeholders, and Indigenous leaders. Over time, co-create a collective understanding of the root causes of environmental justice issues in the local community, brainstorm ways to sustainably address these issues, and empower the community to tackle these issues.

- Enable communication channels for continued support between students and residents, knowledge exchange and future collaborations.
- Engage students and community members in regular meetups and activities to develop a community of students engaged in environmental justice
- Support participants (students and community members) through funding sources
- Secure funding for a competition for participants to propose a new or an extension to an existing EJ project that the winning team can work on for a year.
