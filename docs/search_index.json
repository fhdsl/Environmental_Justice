It targets the lower division level (undergraduate) students, across a variety of disciplines (e.g., biology, social science). “Marketing” could focus on HBCUs, historically-women’s colleges, community colleges, etc. But, it is open to anyone and should be adaptable for that purpose.

What is missing? Is there a place that you thought would show up in EJ screen but does not? What data gap makes that happen? 3.2.3 Tier 3 (Upper Division) 3.3 Social Science: Geared towards students who: * Never have made a map before 3.3.1 Tier 1: Explain how environmental data science tools reflect our understandings of race and can both perpetuate and challenge racism Interpret maps Navigate the EJScreen tool and/or other similar tools to answer relevant, student-generated research questions about environmental (in)justice Understand how these can benefit their own community and neighborhood 3.3.2 Tier 2: 3.3.3 Tier 3: "],["assessment.html", "Chapter 4 Assessment", " Chapter 4 Assessment "],["chapter.html", "Chapter 5 Chapter", " Chapter 5 Chapter If you haven’t yet read the getting started Wiki pages; start there. course materials here!
