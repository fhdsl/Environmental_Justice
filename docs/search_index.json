It targets the lower division level (undergraduate) students, across a variety of disciplines (e.g., biology, social science). “Marketing” could focus on HBCUs, historically-women’s colleges, community colleges, etc. But, it is open to anyone and should be adaptable for that purpose.

Explain how environmental indices can affect their community Evaluate the differences in the tools (EJScreen vs CEJST vs state-based(?) tools) And the benefits/drawbacks of the tools and how underlying data influences results (e.g., EJScreen uses census data - that is biased) Evaluate the positives and negatives of abstracting a place to one number Understand how weighting can impact results Question policy-makers and land managers on environmental justice issues Collaboratively develop action plans to move forward from their findings (wording of this sentence?) Tier 2 (Mid level) Prerequisite Knowledge: Basic introduction to data science and statistical analyses, e.g.  Access data through R Execute pre-written example code and interpret the results Construct and modify R code to test hypotheses Choose a place and tell a story about why it is identified as an EJ place. What is missing? Is there a place that you thought would show up in EJ screen but does not? What data gap makes that happen? 3.1.3 Tier 3 (Upper Division) Prerequisite Knowledge: Student-driven project initiatives (SMART principles) Formulate a testable question Justify why this question is interesting with appropriate background information Create a justified hypothesis Obtain data from public sources (like EJ screen) Process raw data into usable formats Analyze data with appropriate statistical methods to answer the question Visualize data Contextualize results in broader context ((ecological, environmental, community solution, etc) Communicate results through - e.g. a paper, poster, flash talk, other format quantitative models to address scientific questions? Testable question Placed in the context Obtaining, cleaning, transforming, and processing raw data into usable formats? Apply a range of statistical methods for inference and prediction… Build data science products that can be used by a broad audience - or can be transferable to other broader contexts 3.2 Social Science: Geared towards students who - Never have made a map before 3.2.1 Tier 1: Explain how environmental data science tools reflect our understandings of race and can both perpetuate and challenge racism Interpret maps Navigate the EJScreen tool and/or other similar tools to answer relevant, student-generated research questions about environmental (in)justice Understand how these can benefit their own community and neighborhood 3.2.2 Tier 2: Involve in ethnographic studies Be able to infer data with a broad socio-economic context Visualization of data using programming languages such as R Maybe tie-up with different environmental law firms to get a hands-on learning experience by interning/volunteering! 3.2.3 Tier 3: Placement opportunities for students interested in continuing this field of science Introduce public health implications of the data and research? Discuss data ethics?
