## Pre-requisite kno

Learning outcomes by subject:
When students complete this module, they will be able to:

## Science/Data Science (?)

### Tier 1 (Intro level)

- Explain how environmental indices can affect their community
- Evaluate the differences in the tools (EJScreen vs CEJST vs state-based(?) tools)
- And the benefits/drawbacks of the tools and how underlying data influences results (e.g., EJScreen uses census data - that is biased)
- Evaluate the positives and negatives of abstracting a place to one number
- Understand how weighting can impact results
- Question policy-makers and land managers on environmental justice issues
- Collaboratively develop action plans to move forward from their findings (wording of this sentence?) 

### Tier 2 (Mid level)

- Access data through R
- Execute pre-written example code and interpret the results
- Construct and modify R code to test hypotheses
- Choose a place and tell a story about why it is identified as an EJ place. What is missing? Is there a place that you thought would show up in EJ screen but does not? What data gap makes that happen?

### Tier 3 (Upper Division)

## Social Science:

Geared towards students who:
* Never have made a map before


### Tier 1: 

* Explain how environmental data science tools reflect our understandings of race and can both perpetuate and challenge racism 
* Interpret maps
* Navigate the EJScreen tool and/or other similar tools to answer relevant, student-generated research questions about environmental (in)justice
* Understand how these can benefit their own community and neighborhood 

### Tier 2:


### Tier 3:
